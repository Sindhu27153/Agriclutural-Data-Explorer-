# Agriclutural Data Explorer
Agrodata Explorer Analysis bring an insights on cultivation, area used, yield per hectares on various crops in India.
Agro Data Analysis

<h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of agricultural data. It aims to uncover insights into crop production trends, rainfall impact, soil conditions, and fertilizer usage. These insights can help farmers, policymakers, and agribusinesses make informed decisions.

<h2>📊 Features</h2>

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

📈 Crop Yield Analysis: Identifying trends in production across different years and regions.

📊 Visualizations: Interactive charts for better data interpretation.

<h2>🔧 Technologies Used</h2>

Power BI: Interactive dashboard development and visualization

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

SQL: Data querying and transformation

Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration and preprocessing

VS Code: Development environment

<h2>📈 Data Analysis Workflow</h2>

Data Collection: Import agricultural data from various sources (CSV, SQL, etc.).

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and format inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use statistical methods and visualizations.

Dashboard Development: Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
